  "readme": "CONNECT-REST - Exceptionally featureful Restful web services middleware for connect node.js\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/connect-rest.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/connect-rest/)\n\n========\n[connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) is a featureful very easy-to-use middleware for [connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/) for building REST APIs. The library has a stunning feature list beyond basic rest functionality.\n\nJust a few examples: (far from incomplete):\n- __execution branches__: a single service can have multiple paths and a single incoming request can invoke multiple services\n- __versioning__: rest services can be versioned via many ways\n- __regular expressions__: path description can be given using regular expression\n- __parameter mappings__: path matchings can be bound as parameters\n- __service discovery__: built-in rest service allowing one to discover what rest services are available in general or for a given version\n- __\"reflective\" publishing__: by providing a single object, its methods will be published as rest services automatically by simple logic\n- __dynamic API protection__ by Protectors\n- __Multiple contexts__ for flexible orchestrating\n- __customizable HTTP-layer management__: HTTP status code, mime-types, headers, minifying can be set at service and execution level\n- __async services__: a rest service can call back asynchronously when the answer is made\n- __monitoring/measuring__: every rest service execution can be enabled for measurement to be collected and populated internally or for external monitoring solutions\n\n__!Note__: connect-rest's concept is - as for integration - to provide a connect plugin and to be a framework for your rest services carrying only about content and business logic, nothing else. However, in case of need for interoperability, the need might cause you to use only the path-related features alone. This can be done using [dispatchers](#dispatchers).\n\n# Usage\n\nThe [connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) is a simple, yet powerful middleware for [connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/), inspired by [restify](http://mcavage.github.com/node-restify/).\nThe aim is to give a really feature-rich tool allowing you to focus on the business logic only.\n\n\n# Installation\n\n\t$ npm install connect-rest\n\n## Features:\n- [Quick setup](#quick-setup)\n- [Assign](#assign)\n- [Path description](#path-description)\n- [Versioning](#versioning)\n- [Rest functions](#rest-functions)\n- [Customize HTTP response](customize-http-response)\n- [Customize answers of REST functions](#customize-answers-of-rest-functions)\n- [API_KEY management](#api_key-management)\n- [Unprotected rest service](#unprotected-rest-service)\n- [Protector](#protector)\n- [Context](#context)\n- [Orchestrating the contexts](#orchestrating-the-contexts)\n- [Discover services](#discover-services)\n- [Prototype services](#prototype-services)\n- [Logging](#logging)\n- [Reflective publishing](#reflective-publishing)\n- [Domain support](#domain-support)\n- [Answering async rest requests](#answering-async-rest-requests)\n- [Dispatchers](#dispatchers)\n- [Monitoring](#monitoring)\n- [More examples](#more-examples)\n- [License](#license)\n- [Changelog](#changelog)\n\n\n## Quick setup\n\n\t// requires connect and connect-rest middleware\n\tvar connect = require('connect');\n\tvar rest = require('connect-rest');\n\n\t// sets up connect and adds other middlewares to parse query, parameters, content and session\n\t// use the ones you need\n\tvar connectApp = connect();\n\t\t.use( connect.query() )\n\t\t.use( connect.session( { ... } ) )\n\t\t.use( connect.urlencoded() )\n\t\t.use( connect.json() )\n\t;\n\n\t// initial configuration of connect-rest. all-of-them are optional.\n\t// default context is /api, all services are off by default\n\tvar options = {\n\t\tapiKeys: [ '849b7648-14b8-4154-9ef2-8d1dc4c2b7e9' ], // to set up api-key restriction\n\t\tdiscoverPath: 'discover', // activates discovery service\n\t\tprotoPath: 'proto', // activates prototype service\n\t\tlogger:{ name: 'your appname', level: 'info' }, // activates logger\n\t\tcontext: '/api' // general context used for URIs of connect-rest\n\t};\n\n\t// adds connect-rest middleware to connect\n\tconnectApp.use( rest.rester( options ) );\n\n\t// defines a few sample rest services\n\trest.get('/books/:title/:chapter', functionN0 );\n\n\trest.post( { path: '/make', version: '>=1.0.0' }, functionN1 );\n\n\trest.post( [ '/act', '/do' ], functionN2 );\n\n\trest.post( [ { path: '/shake', version: '>=2.0.0' }, { path: '/twist', version: '>=2.1.1' } ], functionN3 );\n\n[Back to Feature list](#features)\n\n\n## Assign\n\n#### direct binding\nYou can assign your rest modules by specifying the needed _http_ request functions: __head, get, post, put, delete__.\n\nExample:\n\n\tfunction service( request, content, callback ){\n\t\tconsole.log( 'Received headers:' + JSON.stringify( request.headers ) );\n\t\tconsole.log( 'Received parameters:' + JSON.stringify( request.parameters ) );\n\t\tconsole.log( 'Received JSON object:' + JSON.stringify( content ) );\n\t\tcallback(null, 'ok');\n\t}\n\trest.post( [ { path: '/shake', version: '>=2.0.0' }, { path: '/twist', version: '>=2.1.1' } ], service );\n\n#### assign function\nOther way to assign is to use the __assign function__ directly.\n\nExample:\n\n\tfunction service( request, content, callback ){\n\t\t...\n\t}\n\t// bind the service funciont to all http request types\n\trest.assign( '*', [ { path: '/shake', version: '>=2.0.0' }, { path: '/twist', version: '>=2.1.1' } ], service );\n\t...\n\t// bind the service funciont to only the given http request types\n\trest.assign( ['head','get','post'], [ { path: '/shake', version: '>=2.0.0' }, { path: '/twist', version: '>=2.1.1' } ], service );\n\n#### parameters\n\nAfter each assign function you might need to pass the followings:\n- a [path description](#path-description)\n- a function to be called.\n\n## Path description\n[connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) supports many options to be used as path description.\n\n\n### Named parameters\n\n\trest.get('/books/:title', functionN0 );\n\nor\n\n\trest.get('/books/:title/:chapter', functionN0 );\n\nYou can define parametrized paths for services to accept REST variables from the caller.\nIn this case, whatever string is after the 'books', will be interpret as variable(s) and passed to the service function via the request object.\n\nSo sending a get request to the uri '/api/books/AliceInWonderland/1', will result the following request object:\n\n\t{\"headers\": ...,\"parameters\":{\"title\":\"AliceInWonderland\", \"chapter\": \"1\"}}\n\n### Optional parameter\n\n\trest.post('/store/?id', functionN );\n\nThis definition allows you to define one optional parameter at the end of the path. It might be called using\n\n\t'/store'\n\nor using\n\n\t'/store/108'\n\npaths. Both HTTP calls will be directed to the same functionN service.\nIn latter case, the '108' will be set as a parameter in the request object with the value of '108'.\n\n### General matcher\n\n\trest.get('/inquire/*book', functionM );\n\nThis definition gives you the possibility to define a general matcher allowing to have been called with anything after the string\n\n\t'/inquire'\n\nso can be called using\n\n\t'/inquire/alice/in/wonderland'\n\nor using\n\n\t'/inquire/oz/the/great/wizard'\n\npaths. This results to have the parameter 'book' with value\n\n\t'alice/in/wonderland' or 'oz/the/great/wizard'\n\nrespectively.\n\nYou can make rather complex mixtures of those options as well:\n\n\t'/borrow/:uid/?isbn/:bookTitle'\n\nOne can call this with uri:\n\n\t'borrow/2/AliceInWonderland' or 'borrow/2/HG1232131/AliceInWonderland'\n\nThe character '*' can be used for both path and version too to make generic bindings:\n\n\t{ path: '*', version: '*' }\n\nBe aware, that this path will be matched to all paths within the defined context.\n\n\n### Special assigns:\nYou can use the all options above at once.\n\n\t[ { path: '/rent/:country/?isbn/*bookTitle', version: '<2.0.0' }, { path: '/borrow/:uid/?isbn/?bookTitle', version: '>=2.1.1' } ]\n\nJust define what you really need. :)\n\n\n### Parameter processing\n\nThe logic how [connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) is managing parameter replacement is the following:\n\nThe parameters are processed in the path definition order and any missing optional parameter will be filled with empty strings to keep the order of them keeping in sight all mandatory parameters put after the optional ones.\n\n\n## Versioning\nAs for versioning, the syntax is [semantic versioning](http://semver.org), the same you use for [npm](https://npmjs.org)\n\n\trest.get( { path: '/special', version: '1.0.0' }, functionN0);\n\nSo you can use different version specificaiton depending on your need:\n\n\tversion: '1.0.0 - 2.9999.9999'\n\tversion: '2.0.1'\n\tversion: '2.x'\n\tversion: '~1'\n\tversion: \">=1.0.2 <2.1.2\"\n\nOnly the requests defining the right version number will match the defined paths.\n\n[connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) ignores all unmatching calls which might fail by the badly given path or version.\n\n[Back to Feature list](#features)\n\n\n## Rest functions\n\nA rest function is a normal JS function you can define easily.\n\nEvery handler function receives\n- a 'request' object containing \"headers\", \"parameters\", \"files\", \"session\" properties\n- an optional 'content' object which is the object extracted from the http body's payload.\n- an optional callback function. This is the 'node standard' way to manage callbacks if needed.\n\nIf callback is used as third parameter, needs to be called and pass the error or result object. Otherwise the return value of rest functions will be sent back to the client as a json string.\n\n\trest.get( { path: '/personal/:uid', version: '1.0.0' }, function( request, content, callback ){\n\t\tcallback( null, { name: 'John Doe' } );\n\t});\n\trest.get( '/purchases/:uid', function( request, content ){\n\t\treturn { purchases: [ ... ] };\n\t});\n\nThe async way is __strongly encouraged__ to be used unless you have something really computation-free function...\n\n[Back to Feature list](#features)\n\n\n## Customize HTTP response\n\nIf one defines a rest function possessing 3 parameters, the third is the callback allowing 3 parameters to send.\nThe first and second parameters are the conventional error and result objects.\n\nThe third one is an object aimed to contain to refine the HTTP response sent back to the client. This includes mime-types, status code, etc.\n\n\n### Status codes\n\n\nAs for status code, all you need to do is this:\n\nError case:\n\n\trest.get( '/invalidPath', function( request, content, callback ){\n\t\tvar error = new Error('invalid path');\n\t\terror.statusCode = 404;\n\t\treturn callback( error );\n\t});\n\nSpecial case when no error occurred, yet the http request's status has to be set:\n\n\trest.get( '/special', function( request, content, callback ){\n\t\treturn callback( null, 'Processing...', { statusCode: 202 } );\n\t});\n\n[Back to Feature list](#features)\n\n### Response headers\n\nTo refine the headers in the response HTML, the way is the same as above: customize the third parameter of the callback function.\n\n\trest.get( '/special', function( request, content, callback ){\n\t\treturn callback( null, 'Content.', { headers: { ETag: \"10c24bc-4ab-457e1c1f\" } } );\n\t});\n\n### Minify response JSON\n\nYou can make the response JSON object minified by passing a single boolean parameter to the callback's third optional parameter:\n\n\trest.get( '/special', function( request, content, callback ){\n\t\t...\n\t\treturn callback( null, '{ \"key\"     :    \"value\" }', { minify: true } );\n\t});\n\nThis will send\n\n\t{\"key\":\"value\"}\n\nto the client.\n\n\n## Customize answers of REST functions\n\nWhen assigning routes with rest API you can pass an object too. This object looks like this:\n\n\t{\n\t\tcontentType: ''\n\t\tvalidator: ...\n\t}\n\nThe contentType defines what the given REST service will retrieve. If not given, 'application/json' will be used.\n\nThe validator is a function, which can be used to determine if the REST function can be called in a given circumstances or should be ignored. This could mean authorization or ip address validation or other security concern.\n\n\trest.post( [ { path: '/shake', version: '>=2.0.0' }, { path: '/twist', version: '>=2.1.1' } ], function( request, content ){\n\t\treturn JSON.stringify(content);\n\t}, null, { contentType:'application/xml', validator: function(req, res){ return _.contains(req.user.roles, \"superuser\"); } } );\n\n[Back to Feature list](#features)\n\n\n## API_KEY management\n\nThe option passed to the [connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) might contain an array enumerating accepted api_keys:\n\n\tvar options = {\n\t\t'apiKeys': [ '849b7648-14b8-4154-9ef2-8d1dc4c2b7e9' ]\n\t\t...\n\t};\n\nIf property 'apiKeys' is present, the associated array of strings will be used as the list of api keys demanded regarding every incoming calls.\nSo having such option, a call should look like this:\n\n\t'/api/books/AliceInWonderland/1?api_key=849b7648-14b8-4154-9ef2-8d1dc4c2b7e9'\n\notherwise error response will be sent with status code 401 claiming: 'API_KEY is required.'.\n\n\n## Unprotected REST service\nWhen you are using API_KEYs, you still might want to have 'exceptions'.\nFunctions which can be served out of the border os API_KEY restriction.\nYou can turn off that protection for a given service like this:\n\n\trest.get( { path: '/special', unprotected: true }, functionN0);\n\n\n## Protector\nProtector is a function which can be passed when creating a rest services and decides if a given call is allowed or should be blocked and ignored.\nSo the protector function called in every rest call when the given path is evaluated and matched and boolean return value of the function tells to the [connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) to allow the rest function's execution to take place or blocked by some security reason.\n\n\trest.get( { path: '/special', protector: function(req, pathname, version){ return true; } }, functionN0);\n\nThe _req_ object, the _pathname_ and api call _version_ is passed and the returning boolean version tells if call is allowed to be performed.\nYou can have such functions to define session-based dynamic protection or differentiate between widely available rest calls and restricted business-sensitive feature.\n\n[Back to Feature list](#features)\n\n\n## Context\n[connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) uses context uri prefix by default to create a speparated 'namespace' for the rest functions.\nYou can define it dynamically:\n\n\trest.context( '/api' ); // means that every rest calls need to be sent to '/api/X' path.\n\nor through the option object as well when you add the middleware to the connect object:\n\n\tvar options = {\n\t\t'context': '/api'\n\t};\n\tconnectApp.use( rest.rester( options ) );\n\nDefault _context_ is the '/api' string.\n\n## Orchestrating the contexts\n\nThe [connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) also allows you to  specify the context at REST function level. This helps if you want to orchestrate your functions using multiple contexts.\nLet me show you:\n\n\trest.get( { path: '/workspace', context: '/pages' }, functionN0);\n\nThis REST function can be called by sending a _GET_ request to the address of\n\n\t/pages/workspace\n\nThis way you can easily manage dynamic templates not being forced to be in the same context as API calls.\n\n__You can orchestrate the contexts of your architecture as it pleases you.__\n\n\n## Discovery services\n[connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) provides a built-in service: discover. Via a simple get request, it allows you - by specifying a version - to discover the plublished REST apis matching the given version.\n\n\tvar options = {\n\t    'discoverPath': 'discover'\n\t};\n\tconnectApp.use( rest.rester( options ) );\n\nThis will enable this service - considering the context described above - on the path '/api/discover/:version'. Sending a get request to - let's say - this path\n\n\thttp://localhost:8080/api/discover/3.0.0\n\nwould retrieve all services which can be called using version 3.0.0 (non-versioned and matching versioned services). The returned JSON is the following:\n\n\t{\n\t\t\"HEAD\":[\"/peek\"],\n\t\t\"GET\":[\"discover/:version\",\"/books/:title/:chapter\"],\n\t\t\"POST\":[\"/store\",{\"path\":\"/make\",\"version\":\">=1.0.0\"},\"/act\",\"/do\",{\"path\":\"/shake\",\"version\":\">=2.0.0\"},{\"path\":\"/twist\",\"version\":\">=2.1.1\"}],\n\t\t\"PUT\":[],\n\t\t\"DELETE\":[]\n\t}\n\n## Prototype services\nThe assign-methods allows you to pass a third parameter, an object which can be considered as a prototype of the expected parameter of the service when a client wants to make a call.\n\n\trest.post( [ { path: '/shake', version: '>=2.0.0' }, { path: '/twist', version: '>=2.1.1' } ], functionN, {'title': 'Alice in Wonderland'} );\n\nThat parameter debriefs the client what structure the functionN expects to receive.\nTo activate this feature, first you have to add a new attribute to the options object:\n\n\tvar options = {\n\t    'apiKeys': [ '849b7648-14b8-4154-9ef2-8d1dc4c2b7e9' ],\n\t    'discoverPath': 'discover',\n\t    'protoPath': 'proto',\n\t    'logger': 'connect-rest'\n\t};\n\nThis 'protoPath' means that sending a request to the server on path:\n\n\t'/api/proto/POST/2.3.0/api/twist?api_key=849b7648-14b8-4154-9ef2-8d1dc4c2b7e9'\n\nwill retrieve the object\n\n\t{'title': 'Alice in Wonderland'}\n\nbecause the service\n\n\ton path '/api/twist' and method 'POST' with version '2.3.0'\n\ncan be called and there is an assigned prototype object to it.\nGiving access method, version and path is mandatory for this feature.\n\n[Back to Feature list](#features)\n\n\n## Logging\nIn the option object passed to the constructor, there is an optional parameter 'logger', which enables the logging functionality:\n\n\tvar options = {\n    \t'apiKeys': [ '849b7648-14b8-4154-9ef2-8d1dc4c2b7e9' ],\n    \t'discoverPath': 'discover',\n    \t'logger': 'connect-rest'\n\t};\n\nor\n\n\tvar options = {\n\t    'apiKeys': [ '849b7648-14b8-4154-9ef2-8d1dc4c2b7e9' ],\n\t    'discoverPath': 'discover',\n\t    'logger': loggerInstance\n\t};\n\nYou can set:\n- a string, which will be interpret as the name of the logger seen in the logs, or\n- passing a logger instance to be used. By default, connect-rest is using [winston](https://github.com/flatiron/winston) as logging library.\n\nIn the absence of 'logger' property, no logs will be made.\nThe [connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) will use level 'info' for entry and exit points of services and 'debug' for the milestones of all internal processes.\n\n[Back to Feature list](#features)\n\n## Reflective publishing\n[connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) allows you to have an extremely easy and fast way to publish your services.\n\nYou can define your own services like this in a file (services.js in this example):\n\n\tfunction health( request ){\n\t\treturn 'ok';\n\t};\n\tfunction record( request, content ){\n\t\treturn 'saved';\n\t}\n\texports.health = health;\n\texports.record = record;\n\nand publish them this way:\n\n\tvar services = require('./services');\n\t...\n\trest.publish( services );\n\nThis will discover all functions assigned to the exports having a name which conforms the following regular expression:\n\n\t/^[a-zA-Z]([a-zA-Z]|\\d|_)*$/g\n\nThe logic is simple. If the function has\n- 1 parameter: it will be a 'get' method\n- 2 parameters: it will be a 'post' method\n\nand the path will be its name. So, by executing one single statement you will automatically have the following services:\n\n\t/health on Get\n\t/record on Post\n\nIf you have 100 services defined, then 100 rest api you will have automatically. Nice.\n\n## Domain support\n[connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) adds support for domain-based error handling. To the options object you can pass a domain too:\n\n\tvar createDomain = require('domain').create;\n\t...\n\tvar superDomain = createDomain();\n\t...\n\tvar restDomain = createDomain();\n\tsuperDomain.add( restDomain );\n\tvar options = {\n\t\tapiKeys: [ '849b7648-14b8-4154-9ef2-8d1dc4c2b7e9' ],\n\t\tdiscoverPath: 'discover',\n\t\tprotoPath: 'proto',\n\t\tlogger: 'connect-rest',\n\t\tdomain: restDomain\n\t};\n\nBy passing the restDomain object, [connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) will assign req and rest object to that domain and in any occurring error, it will be sent to the caller with HTTP status code 500.\n\n[Back to Feature list](#features)\n\n\n## Answering async rest requests\n\n[connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) provides a way to serve async rest requests. It might be important - especially between fragmented server-side environment - to call rest services and accept the answer on a specific callback URL specified by the requestor.\n\nThe _client_ has to specify a request parameter _\"callbackURL\"_ possessing the callback URL where the answer has to be sent.\nHaving sent the request, [connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) will answer it right away with status code _200_ and message _Ok._ and having the result created, it will sent via _HTTP POST_ to the URL given in the HTTP parameters.\n\nThis process is performed behind the scenes, you do not have do anything special about it. If that parameter can be found in the HTTP request, the call will be threaten as async request.\n\n[Back to Feature list](#features)\n\n\n## Dispatchers\n\nIn some cases, you might face with a situation where other 3rd party connect library has to be used and the case might require for path-related logic to be used. [connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) is designed to be able to use as simple path processing helper library as well.\n\n\tconnectApp.use( rest.dispatcher( 'GET', '/dispatcher/:subject', function(req, res, next){\n\t\tres.end( 'Dispatch call made:' + req.params['subject'] );\n\t} ) );\n\nThis simple code makes is pretty straightforward. In case of a _'GET'_ HTTP request coming to the url _'/dispatcher'_, the given function is executed. That function can be any third party connect lib you want to use.\n\n[Back to Feature list](#features)\n\n\n## Monitoring\n\n[connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest) allows you to monitor and measure the execution of the published rest services. Every service execution measure the execution time and reports to a bus transparently. The commulated data is populated regularly as configured.\n\n\tvar options = {\n\t\t...,\n\t\tmonitoring: {\n\t\t\tpopulateInterval: 6000,\n\t\t\tconsole: true,\n\t\t\tlistener: function(data){ ... }\n\t\t}\n\t};\n\nBy adding a monitoring to the options of the library, the monitoring can be activated. The population interval is defined via the _populateInterval_ property measured in millisecs.\n\nThe property _console_ - if present - will print the cumulated execution times grouped/structured by paths and version to the console.\n\nThe property _listener_ - if present - allows you to pass a function which the populated data will be sent to. This way you can define own function to process the collected measurements.\n\n\n## More examples\n\nI have collected a few examples from some implementations submited by users of [connect-rest](https://github.com/imrefazekas/connect-rest).\n\nMight help to have a more complete picture about what you can reach and realize with this library. In case of any wanted scenario, please open a ticket and I will happily comply with it.\n\nExample, how to __restrict rest api calls__ to only those who logged in already, meaning to have some session info\n\n\tvar protectBySession = function(req, pathname, version){\n\t\treturn req.session && req.session.uid;\n\t};\n\trest.get( { path: '/model/person', unprotected: true, protector: protectBySession, version: '1.0.0' }, function( request, content, callback ){\n\t\tcallback( null, personModel );\n\t});\n\nExample to how define a __free-to-call rest function__ in a very restricted environment.\n__Dynamic templating__ is a typical scenario, no versioning is needed, nore api_key or session-based protection, must be put on a separate context and result has mime-type of \"text/html\"\n\n\tvar allower = function(req, pathname, version){\n\t\treturn true;\n\t};\n\trest.get( { path: '/?page/?id', unprotected: true, protector: allower, context: '/pages' }, function( request, content, callback ){\n\t\t// render some page\n\t\trenderer.render( request.parameters.page, request.parameters.id, function(err, res){\n\t\t\tcallback( err, res );\n\t\t} );\n\t}, { contentType:'text/html' } );\n\nA fairly complex REST path which is needed in some cases and a custom return status code:\n\n\trest.get( '/call/:system/?entity/?version/:subject/*', function( request, content, callback ){\n\t\t// Do some business logic\n\t\treturn callback(null, 'Done.', {statusCode:201} );\n\t}, { contentType:'application/json' } );\n\nIn this case you call this path by the following uris:\n\n\t/call/library/books/AliceInWonderland\n\t/call/library/books/2.0/AliceInWonderland\n\t/call/library/AliceInWonderland\n\t/call/library/AliceInWonderland/firstedition/chapter1\n\nNot a typical or strictly REST-conform scenario, but you might end up with the need of complex URIs.\n\n__Tip:__ To manage all calls not handled by connect-rest could be also important. The following code demonstrates how to define a small middleware, which is executed when no REST function is matched.\n\n\tapp.use( rest.rester( options ) );\n\tapp.use( function(req, res, next){\n\t\tif(req.session)\n\t\t\treq.session.destroy();\n\t\t// render error page by some renderer...\n\t\trenderer.render( 'error', {}, function(err, html){\n\t\t\tres.writeHead( 500, { 'Content-Type' : 'text/html' } );\n\t\t\tres.end( html );\n\t\t} );\n\t} );\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Imre Fazekas\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
